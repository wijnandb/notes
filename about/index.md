A place to assemble my notes, so I can find them again whenever I need them.

Is this also suitable for other people? I really don't know, figure that out for yourself.

I have been using several different note-taking tools, and now I'll try to put them  online so they will be accessible and retrievable.

The reason for taking this step is that I'm learning Python and I notice that I am revisiting some sites time and again, so forcing myself to write done how someting works, forces me to really grasp what I am doing. If in the process I create something that is also helpful for others, that's a nice bonus.
