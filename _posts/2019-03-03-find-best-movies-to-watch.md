I want to know which movies I will like on Netflix.

I also would like to be able to pick a movie that the whole family will like, and hasn seen yet.

When I am abroad, I want to know which movies I can see that are not on Dutch Netflix.

How to do this?

I can get a list of all the movies on Netflix in the Netherlands, by scraping all the movies. I can even add a caegory
